% Using the same LaTeX template as Brooke Simmons HST Proposal.
% This is used in HST applications with STScI.
% PHASE I: Archival & Theoretical Research Proposal Template
%
% I'm open to changing the proposal template.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% NOTES ON APPLICATION PROCESS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This application requires the following documentation to be supplied:
%     1. A motivation letter.
%     2. A CV
%     3. A Publication List.
%     4. A Research Proposal
%         i. Maximum of 4 pages.
%         ii. Minimum font size of 11pts.
%         iii. Must include:
%             a. The Research Rationale
%             b. Impact and Past Achievements.
%             c. Research Plans for the Fellowship.
%             d. Synergies with Mission-Related Activities and Scientists at ESA
%
% So, actually, this document is going to be way easier to write than the NASA Hubble one. However,
% let's focus on both of these in conjunction.
